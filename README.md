FYI, my last name is pronounced as though it was spelled "cousin," like the relative. Go figure.

My one-person company is [Kousen IT, Inc.](http://www.kousenit.com). I say "Kousen Eye-Tee", but my wife calls it "Kousen IT" like it was from the Addams Family :)

### Some info:

- You can always find out what I'm doing from my [free newsletter](https://kenkousen.substack.com)
- My [blog](https://kousenit.org) contains posts from my work using Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and more
